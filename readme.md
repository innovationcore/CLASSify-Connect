This project is a REDCap module intended to allow you to publish your forms' data to CLASSify and automatically generate a report from a variety of machine learning models without needing to download data manually or interface with an external application.

Once you have placed the package in the modules folder, make sure to add a _v0.0.0 to the end, or it will not work. This will eventually be replaced with a more automatic versioning system.
